# Tigerjython-Chess
This requires Tigerjython to work.

Its a simple chess game, visualised by the Tigerjython turtle.

When starting the game you have to choose between the default chess starting positions or any other starting position written in FEN code.

After that the game starts just as a normal game of chess would. If it's your turn, you click on any piece you would like to move and the game will show you all the moves you can make by coloring the tiles green. If a enemy chess piece can be killed the surrounding tile will be colored red. To move your piece just click where you want to go and if the move is valide you will go there.

The game ends, when on players king is taken out. This is not currently implemented though.
