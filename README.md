# Tigerjython-Chess
This requires Tigerjython to work.
Open the code of Chess2.py in Tigerjython and execute it there...

This is a simple chess game visualised by the Tigerjython turtle, which, to be clear, is absolutely not meant for this. 

When starting the game, you must choose between the default chess starting positions or any other starting position written in FEN code(a code used for annotating the position of pieces on the board).

After that, the game starts just as a normal game of chess would. If it's your turn, you click on any piece you would like to move, and the game will show you all the moves you can make by colouring the tiles green. If an enemy chess piece can be destroyed, the surrounding tile will be coloured red. To move your piece, click where you want to go; if the move is valid, you will go there.

The game ends when one player, the King, is taken out. This is not currently implemented, though. There may also be some other bugs that need to be found. 

If you're coming from the link in TMS, don't mind the perfectly annotated and readable code; it has gotten far better over the years :D...
